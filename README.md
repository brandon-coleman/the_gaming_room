# The Gaming Room

### Client and Software Requirements:
The Gaming Room is expanding its popular Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application to reach a broader audience across multiple platforms. The software must support multiple teams, unique game and team names, and ensure only one game instance exists in memory at a time.

### Strengths in Documentation Development:
The documentation excels in outlining clear technical requirements, architectural views, and domain models. It provides a structured, step-by-step approach, ensuring clarity and completeness.

### Helpful Aspects of Design Document for Coding:
Working through the design document helped by providing a clear system architecture and domain model. This clarity streamlined development, ensuring adherence to requirements and design constraints.

### Areas for Revision and Improvement:
If revising the document, the evaluation section comparing different operating platforms could be expanded to include more specific metrics or performance benchmarks. This would provide more detailed insights into platform suitability.

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs:
User needs were addressed by ensuring cross-platform compatibility, real-time interactions, and a scalable architecture. This focus on user experience ensures the game performs consistently across devices and platforms.

### Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies:
The design employed object-oriented principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and Singleton patterns to maintain a single game instance. Future projects could benefit from iterative development and user feedback loops to refine design features continuously.
